In this folder the python module will be generated to ensure that also python scripts will use the same enviromment defintions.

For Python module generation, SWIG is used:
sudo apt-get install swig
sudo apt-get install python-dev   #for Python.h

Read: http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Python.html
 
Interface file is needed and stored in this folder.

manual check:
swig -Wall -c++ -python -debug-symbols -I/home/robocup/falcons/code/packages/facilities/environment/include environment.i


The CMakeList.txt will build automatically
