# delta numbers are default maximum delta compared with annotated position
# all sigma numbers are one standard deviation and apply at a certain given distance (scaling)

# 'stationary' means that all robots are standing still (for example at initialization, or soon after STOP was issued)
# 'dynamic' is the converse: at least one robot is moving
# some reasons to distinguish between stationary and dynamic situation:
# * impact of latency (encoders, vision)
# * multiCam may not be able to keep up

# 'still' or 'moving' applies to the object of interest (a ball or an obstacle)
# tolerances typically scale linearly with distance, the numbers apply to given distance
