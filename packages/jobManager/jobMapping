# Job definitions.
# According to Erik, this is similar to SystemManager in Twinscan software: jobs are sets of processes.
# Here, a job is actually a set of jobs and processes.
# So each job evaluates to a list of processes (see jobToProcess)
#
# JFEI 2015-11-11
# MKOE 2016-12-27 added tpCoach
# 



# note: the following processes are managed outside of job context (via simControl, coachControl and robotControl)
# roscore, robotControl, robotHealth, globalConfig, simteam
