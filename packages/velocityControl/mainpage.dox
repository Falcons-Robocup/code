\b velocityControl 

<!-- 
VelocityControl controls and computes the velocity-based motion commands of the robot.
A target (vel, acc) is received from PathPlanning, which is translated into a velocity per motor.
Each motor's velocity is communicated through PeripheralsInterface.

This component functions event-based on events from PathPlanning (HeartBeat) and PeripheralsInterface (new motor data).
